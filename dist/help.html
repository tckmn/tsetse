                    <h2>How to play</h2>

                    <p>
                    In general,
                    you will see a collection of cards on the board,
                    and your goal is to find ones that form a "set".
                    The rules for what a "set" is are different for each variant;
                    all of them are explained below.
                    When you've found a set,
                    you can click or tap the cards to select them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    To submit a set,
                    press the <strong>checkmark button</strong> in the bottom right.
                    You can also press <strong>Enter</strong>,
                    if you're playing on a computer.
                    In some set variants,
                    all cards have the same number of sets,
                    in which case your sets will be submitted automatically.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In the sidebar,
                    you will find <strong>scores</strong>
                    (which count how many cards each player has taken)
                    as well as <strong>preferences</strong>
                    for each variant
                    (e.g. how many cards to display per row).
                    </p>

                    Here is an example of a set in C53T:

                    A set consists of <strong>exactly 5 cards</strong>
                    such that for each pentagon
                    (light, medium, and dark),
                    the 5 pentagons overlaid on top of each other
                    form a pattern <strong>with a line of reflectional symmetry</strong>.
                    In the above example,
                    the light pentagon is symmetric across the red line,
                    the medium pentagon is symmetric across the orange line,
                    and the dark pentagon is symmetric across all 5 lines.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Here is a sketch of all the ways
                    for the lines on a set of 5 cards to be symmetric,
                    up to rotation:

                    <p>
                    Here is an example of a set in FO1D:

                    <p>
                    A set is a collection of cards with non-overlapping creases,
                    which form a <strong>flat-foldable crease pattern</strong> when overlaid.
                    Red lines represent mountain creases,
                    and blue lines represent valley creases.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    To figure this out in practice,
                    it is enough to know the following fact:
                    if a single-vertex crease pattern is flat-foldable,
                    you can always fold it by making a series of <strong>crimps</strong>
                    (and you can never ruin it by making a "wrong" crimp).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    To make a crimp,
                    find a mountain crease and a valley crease
                    where the distance between the two creases
                    is at least as large as the distance to any other creases.
                    </p>

                    <p><img src='/img/foid1.png' class='foidhelp'></p>

                    <p>
                    Then fold both creases.
                    This effectively deletes the paper between the two creases,
                    as well as the same amount of paper on one side.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    If your cards are a set,
                    you will be able to repeatedly do this
                    until there are just 2 creases left,
                    at which point they will form a single line
                    and can be folded straight through.
                    </p>

                    Here are some other useful lemmas for finding sets in this variant:

                    <ul>
                        <li>A set must contain either 3 or 5 cards.</li>
                        <li>A set must satisfy the Kawasaki condition: the sum of alternating angles is 180&deg;.</li>
                        <li>The number of mountain creases and the number of valley creases in a set must differ by exactly 2.</li>
                    </ul>
