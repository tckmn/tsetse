                    <p>
                    In general,
                    you will see a collection of cards on the board,
                    and your goal is to find ones that form a "set".
                    The rules for what a "set" is are different for each variant;
                    all of them are explained below.
                    When you've found a set,
                    you can click or tap the cards to select them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    To submit a set,
                    press the <strong>checkmark button</strong> in the bottom right.
                    You can also press <strong>Enter</strong>,
                    if you're playing on a computer.
                    In some set variants,
                    all cards have the same number of sets,
                    in which case your sets will be submitted automatically.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    In the sidebar,
                    you will find <strong>scores</strong>
                    (which count how many cards each player has taken)
                    as well as <strong>preferences</strong>
                    for each variant
                    (e.g. how many cards to display per row).

                    A set consists of <strong>exactly 5 cards</strong>
                    such that for each pentagon
                    (light, medium, and dark),
                    the 5 pentagons overlaid on top of each other
                    form a pattern <strong>with a line of reflectional symmetry</strong>.
                    In the above example,
                    the light pentagon is symmetric across the red line,
                    the medium pentagon is symmetric across the orange line,
                    and the dark pentagon is symmetric across all 5 lines.

                    <p>
                    Here is a sketch of all the ways
                    for the lines on a set of 5 cards to be symmetric,
                    up to rotation:

                    <p>
                    Here is an example of a set in FO1D:
                    </p>

                    <p id='FO1Dex'></p>

                    <p>
                    A set is a collection of cards with non-overlapping creases,
                    which form a <strong>flat-foldable crease pattern</strong> when overlaid.
                    Red lines represent mountain creases,
                    and blue lines represent valley creases.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    To figure this out in practice,
                    it is enough to know the following fact:
                    if a single-vertex crease pattern is flat-foldable,
                    you can always fold it by making a series of <strong>crimps</strong>
                    (and you can never ruin it by making a "wrong" crimp).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    To make a crimp,
                    find a mountain crease and a valley crease with no creases in between,
                    where the distance between the two creases
                    is at most as large as the distance to any other creases.
                    </p>

                    <p><img src='/img/foid1.png' class='foidhelp'></p>

                    <p>
                    Then fold both creases.
                    This effectively deletes the paper between the two creases,
                    as well as the same amount of paper on one side.
                    </p>

                    <p><img src='/img/foid2.png' class='foidhelp'></p>

                    <p>
                    If your cards are a set,
                    you will be able to repeatedly do this
                    until there are just 2 creases left,
                    at which point they will form a single line
                    and can be folded straight through.
                    </p>

                    <p><img src='/img/foid3.png' class='foidhelp'></p>

                    <p>
                    For a proof of this fact, see
                    <a href='https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.849/fall20/lectures/L02.html'>lecture 2 of Geometric Folding Algorithms</a>,
                    a class taught by Erik Demaine at MIT that inspired this variant.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Here are some other useful lemmas for finding sets in this variant:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>A set must contain either 3 or 5 cards.</li>
                        <li>A set must satisfy the Kawasaki condition: the sum of alternating angles is 180&deg;.</li>
                        <li>The number of mountain creases and the number of valley creases in a set must differ by exactly 2.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p class='helpsub'>pronounced "fold-set"</p>

                    <p>
                    Here is an example of a set in FOLD:
                    </p>

                    <p id='FOLDex'></p>

                    <p>
                    FOLD is very similar to <a href='#FO1D'>FO1D</a>;
                    you should read those rules if you haven't already.
                    The only difference is that FOLD cards have two vertices instead of one,
                    and they are connected by an unassigned crease present on every card.
                    A collection of a cards is a set
                    if it is flat-foldable for either assignment of the center crease
                    (but both vertices have to agree).
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The specific layout of creases in FOLD --
                    that is, six equally spaced creases around each vertex --
                    lends itself to a set of rules
                    equivalent to flat-foldability,
                    but making no reference to folding.
                    You may find that you can find sets faster
                    using this characterization instead of making mental crimps.
                    In particular,
                    all sets contain either 3 or 5 cards.
                    For 3-card sets:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A set must contain an
                            <strong>even number of two-color cards</strong>
                            (i.e. cards with both red and blue).
                            This guarantees the existence
                            of an assignment for the center crease
                            that satisfies both vertices,
                            and in fact there is a unique one:
                            each vertex must have either 3 red and 1 blue
                            or 3 blue and 1 red.
                            So in the above example,
                            the center crease should be red.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The pattern of creases around each vertex
                            must form a <strong>"chicken foot"</strong> --
                            i.e. <strong>three equally spaced creases plus an extra crease</strong>.
                            <p><img src='/img/chicken.svg' style='height:150px'></p>
                            The chicken foot can appear in any rotation;
                            in the above example,
                            the top foot has its heel pointing northeast,
                            and the bottom foot has its heel pointing south.
                            (This requirement is equivalent to the Kawasaki condition.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            As mentioned,
                            each vertex must have 3 of one color and 1 of the other.
                            <strong>The "heel" of the foot cannot be the odd one out.</strong>
                            In the above example,
                            both vertices have 3 red and 1 blue,
                            so the heels have to be red.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                    For 5-card sets,
                    there is only one requirement:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The number of mountain creases and the number of valley creases
                            around each vertex
                            must <strong>differ by exactly 2</strong>.
                            Again,
                            this means that there must be an even number of two-color cards,
                            but that is no longer sufficient to guarantee
                            that this requirement holds.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                    You may note that all of the conditions above
                    only talk about each vertex separately;
                    indeed,
                    the only way the two vertices interact
                    is by requiring that they agree on the assignment of the center crease.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    OCTA is all about how to get from one card to another.
                    A set is three cards
                    such that the way to go from the first card to the second card
                    is the same as the way to go from the second card to the third card.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    There are
                    <strong>four different ways</strong> to think about going from one card to another,
                    and they are all equivalent (!).
                    </p>

                    <ul>

                            The bottom half of each card
                            depicts a cube where some faces are "hollow".
                            Opposite faces of the cube are the same color
                            but different hollowness,
                            so you can always tell what all the faces are

                            The transformation from one card to another
                            is an <strong>isometry of the cube</strong>;
                            i.e. a rotation, reflection, or combination of both.
                            In the above example,
                            the rotation is 90&deg; clockwise
                            around the line that goes through the center of the green face:

                            <p>
                            Note that from the first card to the second card,
                            the hollow red face rotates clockwise,
                            and the hollow blue face (which was previously hidden)
                            rotates into view.
                            Similarly,
                            from the second card to the third card,
                            the hollow blue face rotates clockwise,
                            and the solid red face rotates into view.

                            The top half of each card
                            depicts an octahedron.
                            Opposite faces are again the same color.
                            Furthermore,
                            each octahedron has a swirl on top
                            representing the handedness of the octahedron:
                            since opposite faces are indistinguishable,
                            the swirl is necessary to tell you
                            whether the octahedron is reflected or not.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            The transformation from one card to another
                            is an <strong>isometry of the octahedron</strong>.
                            In the above example,
                            the rotation is 90&deg; clockwise
                            around the line that goes from the top vertex
                            to the bottom vertex.
                            So from the first card to the second card,
                            the purple and green rotate one space over,
                            and the pink rotates behind the octahedron
                            where the orange used to be,
                            which is rotated into view.
                            The rotation from the second card to the third card is the same.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Note that the isometry of the octahedron
                            is the same as the isometry of the cube --
                            this is not a coincidence.

                            The transformation from one card to another
                            is a <strong>permutation of the positions,

                            you swap the bottom two positions
                            and toggle the hole in the bottom right position.

                            plus a swirl,

                            The transformation from one card to another

                            you move top-left to bottom,

                            and center to top-left;
                            and you do not flip the swirl.

                    all four characterizations are equivalent,
                    so you can find all sets by ignoring the cube
                    and only looking at the octahedron
                    or vice versa.

                    <p>
                    A5SET is very similar to <a href='#OCTA'>OCTA</a>;

                    a set is three cards where the operation from the first to the second
                    is the same as the operation from the second to the third,

                    <p>
                    There is a very useful lemma
                    for finding sets in A5SET;
                    to demonstrate it,
                    here is another example of a set in A5SET:
                    </p>

                    <p id='A5SETex2'></p>

                    <p>
                    You will notice that in the first example,
                    the bottom right face of the dodecahedron is yellow in all of the cards;
                    and in the second example,
                    the bottom left and top right faces of the icosahedron are the same in all cards.
                    In fact,
                    there are only two classes of rotations that can form sets in A5SET:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Rotations that <strong>fix exactly once dodecahedron face color</strong>,
                            like the first example.
                            (These correspond to order 5 group elements.)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Rotations that <strong>fix exactly two icosahedron face colors</strong>,
                            like the second example.
                            (These correspond to order 3 group elements.)
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                    Furthermore,
                    all rotations that fit the above conditions form sets;
                    for example,
                    if you find three cards
                    where one of the dodecahedron faces is the same in all cards
                    and all other dodecahedron faces are different in all cards,
                    you can be sure it's a set.
