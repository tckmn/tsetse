                    <p>
                    This is a collection of various variants on the card game
                    <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(card_game)'>Set</a>.
                    They are all original ideas developed by members of

                    An average of 1 physical deck exists in the universe
                    for each of these variants.
                    If you want to try playing with them,
                    come visit ET.
                    I promise it's worth it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    The rules for each variant are explained below.

                    Here is an example of a set in C53T:
                    </p>

                    <p id='C53Tex'></p>

                    <p>
                    A set consists of exactly 5 cards
                    such that for each pentagon
                    (light, medium, and dark),
                    the 5 pentagons overlaid on top of each other
                    form a pattern with a line of reflectional symmetry.
                    In the above example,
                    the light pentagon is symmetric across the red line,
                    the medium pentagon is symmetric across the orange line,
                    and the dark pentagon is symmetric across all 5 lines.

                    <p>
                    Here is a sketch of all the ways
                    for the lines on a set of 5 cards to be symmetric,
                    up to rotation:

                    The underlying mathematical object

                    whence the name;

                    for the cyclic group of order 5.
                    The rule can equivalently be stated as
                    "pick 5 cards that add to the identity".
